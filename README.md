# The-ABC-formula-solver
this script can solve any ABC formula from any rank 
----------------------------------------------------
this is my first script in python
i did code it without any experience in python, i just know half the basics
as i started learning it to solve a question in my math book for 12th grade.
i did this just for fun and it wasn't hard ,because i have some knoledge about
tech and computer science.
----------------------------------------------------
The math question that i used to do this 
----------------------------------------
TASK:
-----
We consider the function defined on [-1;2] :
      f(x)=2(x**3)-3(x**2)-1
(1) Calculate f'(x) and form a table of changes of the function.
(2) Draw the graph of the function " on the screen of a graphing calculator
using an appropriate window.
(3) Show that equation f(x) = 0 accepts a single solution
In [-1;2].
(4) Using a graphing calculator, find out for this solution its capacity
10Â².
-----------------------------------------
the answer for (4) is: x range: [1.66 to 1.68] , f(x) range: [-0.196 to 0.0269]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
with those inputs:
------------------
===Enter equation rank 1 to 3(for fast result) or up: 3
===Equation =? : 0
===Num Of Digits After ',' 2 for 0.00 3 for 0.000 or any: 2
===Enter x start point: 1
===Enter x reach limit: 2
===Enter numerical coefficients
===Enter numerical number 1: 2
===Enter numerical number 2: -3
===Enter numerical number 3: 0
===Enter numerical number 4: -1
